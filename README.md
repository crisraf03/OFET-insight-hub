# OFET-insight-hub
this is a project that was created during my undergraduate project in physics, it consists in the automation of the characterization of OFET organic transistors.  It consists mainly of two kinds of objects, ofet and set_ofet where recursively create graphs, calculate parameters and extract in excel tables.
